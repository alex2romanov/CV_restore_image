# Matrix Completion
Image restoration is the process of recovering an image from a degraded versionâ€”usually a blurred and noisy image. Image restoration is a fundamental problem in image processing, and it also provides a good ground for more general inverse problems. There are several approaches to the image restoration problem, starting from the traditional methods that revolve around the matrix completion problem, as far as the deep learning approaches that are mainly based on the U-Net backbone architecture. 


In this project, we tackle a special subclass of image restoration problem sometimes referred in the literature as pixel interpolation. 
The research approach as well as utilized algorithms to solve the given image restoration problem will be tackled in the following chapters. 

In the file `gradient_algorithms.ipynb` you can find the formulation of the problem and numerical approach solutions: Fast Gradient algorithm, FISTA and DRS. In the file `UNet.ipynb` you can find a deep learning solution of the problem.
